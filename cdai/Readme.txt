The proccess used to collect data from the spreadsheet was
written as a java application in eclipse. The general principal was to think
of this data as a 2D array. I had a 2D array which would hold the students
information including their names, a made up student ID, and their emphasis.
I also had an array that would hold the assessment names which had to search
for the dates that would coincide with that AI. This information was then stored 
as an additional array. From this assessment names I was able to create each criteria's
name by finding what how many scores followed. Then by using the row numbers to find
out who scored what and the column numbers to find out what assessment and crtieria
they scored with. All of this was writting in insert statements to a file that
was imported to the database.
